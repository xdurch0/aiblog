We explore building generative neural network models of popular reinforcement learning environments. Our *world model* can be trained quickly in an unsupervised manner to learn a compressed spatial and temporal representation of the environment. By using features extracted from the world model as inputs to an agent, we can train a very compact and simple policy that can solve the required task. We can even train our agent entirely inside of its own dream environment generated by its world model, and transfer this policy back into the actual environment.

Here's somse stuff.

I wonder what a really big heading looks like?

# BIG HEADing Here Now

Here is a test cication: <dt-cite key="sutton_barto,memory_consolidation"></dt-cite> Let's hope this does something!

Or how about a footnote? <dt-fn>I use too many footnotes. But whatever. Looks professional.</dt-fn>
